# sample_lib
This is a copy of NASA's Sample Lib version sample_lib-equuleus-rc1. It has been augmented with a Basecamp JSON spec so it can be installed using Basecamp's project feature. The CMakeLists.txt files was modified to match Basecamp's cFS version, but the code is unmodified. Retains NASA's Apache 2.0 license.
